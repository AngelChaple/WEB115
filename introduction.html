            <strong>Personal Background:</strong> I am originally from Cuba,
            moved here at the age of 9 years old. I have lived in CLT ever
            since. I love the outdoors, hiking, camping, fishing, you name it. I
            love music and love to play my guitar as well as any percussion
            instrument you put in front of me. I am taking this class with my
            sister Ani. Her introduction was right before mine.

          <p>
            <strong>Professional Background:</strong> I have worked in the
            medical field since I graduated high school as a Translator. I now
            work for atrium health in the language access team as a data analyst
            part time as well as still assisting with translation.

            <strong>Academic Background:</strong> I graduated from high school
            back in 2016 and began working right away. While working part time,
            I've been slowly taking a couple classes at CPCC since 2019 and am
            very close to graduating.

            <strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I have taken WEB110 and
            CIS110 previous to this class back in 2022. I am very familiar with
            the external resources being used in this course like freecodecamp
            and codecademy which I have used in those previous classes to
            improve my front end skills.
          </p>

          <strong>Courses Im taking & why</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting -</strong> I believe
              this course will deepen my knowledge of Web development with
              technologies like HTML, CSS, and JS. I believe I have a very
              superfluous knowledge of these and wish to really become
              proficient in them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>CSC121 - Python Programming - </strong>I love Python, it
              was the first programming language I taught myself. I have built
              very simple and console based applications but I wish to become a
              Python expert and become able to develop production ready
              applications.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>WEB140 - Web Development Tools - </strong> I think this
              class is crucial because it dives into very popular and widely
              used technologies like wordpress which is huge in the web
              development field. Since I am interested in working as a freelance
              web developer in the future I think this course will be crucial to
              my success.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DBA120 - Database Programming - </strong>Databases are
              very important when developing a full stack web application and
              learning SQL is crucial. I hope to become proficient in database
              programming by the end of this course and be able to work with
              large databases.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by: </strong>I am
          obsessed with computer science. In my freetime I follow coding
          tutorials and watch tech videos, listen to podcasts, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>I'd also like to Share: </strong>I like to play video games even
        though I'm not great at them but I find it relaxing and calming after a
        long day.
